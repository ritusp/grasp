### Overview
More advanced mathematical skills are based on an early math “foundation”—just like a house is built on a strong foundation. 
My web application will be for kids mainly for early learners. This application will help kids to improve their math skills to do even big calculations faster.
While working as an instructor, I saw many young kids struggling with numbers. Result was crying, didn't want to do math, spending time in the bathroom....  As most of the kids like to work on electronics, I thought of this application to speed up their math skills. 

### Features

1. User Login: Parents will create their login first. Then they will create their kid's login. They can add kids also if they want to create login for other kids. 
2. Practice Test: Kids can practice math after choosing the topic. After practicing they can give test. They can also see their scores.
3. Reports: Parents can see their kid's current and all the previous scores in tabular form as well as graph.
